%	Apply "SimpleKMeans" to your data. In Weka euclidian distance is implemented in SimpleKmeans. You can set the number of clusters and seed of a random algorithm for generating initial cluster centers. Experiment with the algorithm as follows:
%	
%	1. Choose a set of attributes for clustering and give a motivation. (Hint: always ignore attribute "name". Why?) 
%	2. Experiment with at least two different numbers of clusters, e.g. 2 and 5, but with the same seed value 10.
%	3. Then try with a different seed value, i.e. different initial cluster centers. Compare the results with the previous results.
%	4. Do you think the clusters are "good" clusters? (Are all of its members "similar" to each other? Are members from different clusters dissimilar?)
%	5. What does each cluster represent? Choose one of the results. Make up labels (words or phrases in English) which characterize each cluster.
